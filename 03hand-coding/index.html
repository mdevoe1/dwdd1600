        <p>Key programmers, designers, and planners who built the game's complex puzzles, resource management systems,
            and iconic environments such as the Spencer Mansion.</p>

        <h3>Kenichi Iwao</h3>
        <p>Scenario writer responsible for developing much of the original game's lore, including the creation of the
            Umbrella Corporation, the T-virus, and the backstories of the main characters.</p>
